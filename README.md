# 📈 AI19642 - Time Series Analysis and Forecasting

Welcome to the **AI19642 - Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Repository**! This collection of Jupyter Notebooks, hosted on **Google Colab**, explores various techniques and methodologies for analyzing and forecasting time series data. 📊⏳

## 📂 Notebooks

1. 📘 [Time Series Experiment 1]
2. 📙 [Time Series Experiment 2]
3. 📗 [Time Series Experiment 3]

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore these time series experiments, simply **open the links in Google Colab** and execute the cells in order. Ensure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Some notebooks may require **GPU/TPU acceleration**, which you can enable in Colab’s runtime settings. ⚡

## 🛠 Requirements

These notebooks utilize various Python libraries for time series analysis and forecasting. Install any missing dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(If a `requirements.txt` file is not available, check the imports in the notebooks and install them manually.) 🏗

## 🎯 Usage

1. 🔗 Open the respective notebook link in Google Colab.
2. ▶️ Run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
3. 🛠 Modify parameters or code as needed to experiment with different forecasting techniques.
